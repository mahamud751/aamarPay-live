# Server Call Optimization Checklist

This checklist ensures all optimization requirements have been met for improving server calls in the application.

## ✅ Caching Implementation

### In-Memory Caching

- [x] Created cache with TTL (Time To Live)
- [x] Implemented cache for individual events (`event_{id}`)
- [x] Implemented cache for all events list (`allEvents`)
- [x] Implemented cache for user events list (`userEvents`)
- [x] Set appropriate cache duration (5 minutes)
- [x] Added cache cleanup for expired entries

### Cache Usage

- [x] Check cache before making API calls
- [x] Store API responses in cache
- [x] Return cached data when available
- [x] Handle cache misses appropriately

## ✅ Request Deduplication

### Duplicate Request Prevention

- [x] Implemented pending requests tracker
- [x] Prevent multiple simultaneous requests for same data
- [x] Return existing promise for duplicate requests
- [x] Clear pending requests after completion

## ✅ Retry Mechanism

### Exponential Backoff

- [x] Created retry utility functions
- [x] Implemented exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, etc.)
- [x] Set default retry attempts (3)
- [x] Applied retry mechanism to all API calls

### Error Handling

- [x] Retry on network failures
- [x] Retry on server errors (5xx)
- [x] Don't retry on client errors (4xx)
- [x] Provide fallback after max retries

## ✅ Enhanced API Configuration

### Request Interceptors

- [x] Added request timeout (10 seconds)
- [x] Added request metadata for tracking
- [x] Implemented token handling
- [x] Added request logging

### Response Interceptors

- [x] Added response duration tracking
- [x] Implemented error logging
- [x] Added network error handling
- [x] Enhanced error messages

## ✅ Cache Invalidation

### Automatic Invalidation

- [x] Clear cache on create operations
- [x] Clear cache on update operations
- [x] Clear cache on delete operations
- [x] Clear related cache entries

### Manual Invalidation

- [x] Provided function to clear specific event cache
- [x] Provided function to clear all event cache
- [x] Easy cache management API
